Python may be used for generating test data or plots, as long as it only uses the python standard library. 
Write all other code in modern modules c++ available in gcc 14.2.0.
We do not use separate header and implementation files: the entire module goes in a .cpp file.
You do not have the correct compile flags to use import statements for the standard library, but no worries, we can use the regular #include for them.
Start each file with "module;", then #includes, then "export module {module name};".
Each .cpp file should export one and only class/namespace/struct/thingy that should have the exact same name as the module AND the file name.
We use pascal case for types, and camel case for everything else.
Do not use abbreviations nor acronyms, write out entire words, except for when the abbreviation is more common than the full word such as:
- "id" for identifier
- "max" and "min" for maximum and minimum
or similar.
We do not need EMPTY newlines after methods or functions nor after variable declarations, and also never anywhere inside of function bodies.
However, there are newlines after semicolons, as usual.
